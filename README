#
# D_Shell is a version of tinyshell. Made for the completion of DT211 System Integration 
#
#
#
#
#
# Several Commands are permitted 
#
#
#
# Two Internal commands to which the code holds the code to produce.
#	dt - date command 
# 	ud - User details command 
# 
# Two External commmands - to which the shell calls 
#	ifc - ifconfig - network interface info 
# 	pw - directory path 

# To implement this shell :
#
#	1. Using sudo create an user account with the following command 
		$sudo useradd <username>
		$sudo passwd <username>
	2. Then clone this reposority to /bin -- you will need to use sudo 
	3. Change the file permissions using this command 
		sudo chmod 755 D_Shell.py
		sudo chmod 755 D_Shellrc 
		sudo chmod 755 D_Shell.config 

		(7 - read,write, execute--Owner)(5 - read, execute -- Group)(5 - read,execute --Others)

	4. Set the bash envorinment for <username> to that directory with the following command 
			sudo usermod -s /bin/C13469208_SI_Shell/D_Shell.py 

	5. To confirm the above the following command will show the <username> details and shell path 
				cat /etc/passwd
